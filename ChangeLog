= Version 0.3 =

  - Add support for SNMP tables (this significantly changed the API).
  - Remove boost dependencies.
  - Improve the build system.
  - Add a logo, update doxygen documentation design.
  - Add a release process (consisting of a script and according
    documentation).

= Version 0.2 =

  - Implemented GetNext handling.
  - Implemented Notifications support.
  - Implemented support for SET requests.
  - Renamed some classes (e.g. master_proxy -> MasterProxy).
  - Fixed some small issues.

= Version 0.1.1 =

  - Reworked the networking code. This fixes a bug which appeared on debian
    systems.
  - SCons now checks for the tools and libraries required for building
    agentXcpp.
  - Start using portable types from the boost libraries (e.g. uint8_t). This
    makes the code more portable.
  - Code Cleanup

= Version 0.1 =

  This version supports writing subagents which can handle 'Get' requests for 
  SNMP objects (but no other requests are supported, not even Get-Next). All 
  SNMP objects defined by RFC 2741 are supported (Integer, Octet_String, 
  IpAddress, etc.). Only complete subtrees can be registered for an subagent, 
  which means that the master agent will forward all requests for OIDs within 
  this subtree to the registering subagent. Single OIDs cannot be registered, 
  and it is not possible to share tables with other subagents (i.e. no index 
  allocation is supported). Notifications (a.k.a. traps) are also not provided.
 
  This version is not usable for real-world projects, since it doesn't support 
  'Set' requests and notifications.

About
-----

This is the AgentXcpp library, a C++ library to implement SNMP MIBs through the 
AgentX protocol.

This README introduces the directory structure and describes how to build the 
documentation. Further information can be found in the documentation.


Directory Structure
-------------------

The top level directory contains the following elements:

doc/ This directory contains the documentation. Note that the documentation is 
     created using Doxygen and most of it is contained in the source code.  The 
     doc/ directory contains the doxygen configs, some additional documentation 
     files and a Makefile to build the documentation.

src/ This directory contains the source code of the library.

main.cpp This is very hackish test code, just to try out parts of the library.  
	 It is not meant to be part of the library and serves as development 
	 aid only. Hopefully it will be replaced by test suite.

Makefile This Makefile provides the possibility to build the library and the
	 documentation.

rfc2741_AgentX.txt The RFC describing the AgentX protocol. This is the 
		   reference for the AgentXcpp implementation.


Documentation
-------------

There are two types of HTML documentation. The API documentation describes the 
AgentXcpp API and is intended for the user of the library. The internals 
documentation is the complete reference of the library, describing all 
internals, including other things such as the build system.

To build the documentation, cd to the top level directory (the one containing 
this README) and type
    
    make documentation

This builds both documentations. To build only one of the documentations, cd 
into the doc/ directory and use one of the following commands:
    
    make api-doc

or
    
    make internals-doc

After buidling, the documentation can be displayed by pointing a web browser to 
doc/api/html/index.html respectively doc/internals/html/index.html.

Happy hacking :-)

About this README
-----------------

This README gives a short overview of the agentXcpp project, introduces the 
repository's directory structure and describes how to build the documentation.  
Further information can then be found in the documentation.


About agentXcpp
---------------

AgentXcpp is a C++ implementation of the AgentX protocol (RFC 2741).

The AgentX protocol is used to implement SNMP MIBs as subagents, which are 
separate processes connecting to a master agent, which in turn provides a SNMP 
interface to the outside world.


Status of the project
---------------------

This software is currently NOT USABLE.

It is work in progress.  Unfortunately, the author has little time to work on 
the software. Here is the release plan. Note that this plan may change.
 
  Version 0.1 (end of 2011 was missed. New goal: March/2012)
    GET functionality working, source code and build system are cleaned up, 
    complete documentation of implementation internals is available.
 
  Version 0.2
    SET functionality and Notifications/Traps working.
 
  Version 0.3 (latest by end of 2012)
    Tables are working. User documentation (including full API documentation) 
    is available.

Directory Structure
-------------------

The top level directory contains the following elements:

AUTHORS
	Contains the author(s) of the agentXcpp library.

LICENSE
	Contains the AgentXcpp library LICENSE, which basically consists of 	 
	the GPL and an additional linking exception.

GPLv3
	Contains the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, Version 3.

README
	This file.

SConstruct
	AgentXcpp is built using SCons. This file provides the possibility to 
	build the library and the documentation.

doc/
	This directory contains the documentation. The documentation is created 
	using Doxygen and most of the content is contained in the source code.  
	The doc/ directory contains the doxygen configs, some additional 
	documentation files (*.dox) and the RFC 2741.

src/
	This directory contains the source code of the library.


unit_tests/
	This directory contains the unit tests for the agentXcpp components.  
	Note that this is currently rather a skeleton, and no tests are 
	available yet.


Documentation
-------------

There are two types of HTML documentation, the API documentation and the 
'internals' documentation.  The API documentation describes the AgentXcpp API 
and is intended for the user of the library. The internals documentation is the 
complete reference of the library, describing all internals, including things 
such as the build system.

You can build the documentation using SCons or without SCons.

1a) With SCons:
    cd to the top level directory (the one containing this README) and type
    
      scons

    This builds the library as well as both documentations.

1b) Without SCons:
    cd into the doc/ directory and type

      doxygen api.doxyfile

    respectively
    
      doxygen internals.doxyfile

2)  After building, the documentation can be displayed by pointing a web 
    browser to

      doc/api/html/index.html
    
    respectively

      doc/internals/html/index.html.



Happy hacking :-)

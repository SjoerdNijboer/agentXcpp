About this README
-----------------

This README gives a short overview of the agentXcpp project, introduces the 
repository's directory structure and describes how to build the documentation.  
Further information can then be found in the documentation.


About agentXcpp
---------------

AgentXcpp is a C++ implementation of the AgentX protocol (RFC 2741).

The AgentX protocol is used to implement SNMP MIBs as subagents, which are 
separate processes connecting to a master agent, which in turn provides a SNMP 
interface to the outside world.


Status of the project
---------------------

This software is currently NOT USABLE.

It is work in progress.  Unfortunately, the author has little time to work on 
the software. It is expected that basic functionality is available by end of 
2011.

Directory Structure
-------------------

The top level directory contains the following elements:

doc/ This directory contains the documentation. The documentation is created
     using Doxygen and most of the content is contained in the source code.  
     The doc/ directory contains the doxygen configs, some additional 
     documentation files (*.dox) and a SConscript to build the documentation.

doc/rfc2741_AgentX.txt The RFC describing the AgentX protocol. This is the 
                       reference for the AgentXcpp implementation.

src/ This directory contains the source code of the library and a SConscript to
     build it.

SConstruct This file provides the possibility to build the library and the
	   documentation.

examples/ This is very hackish test code, just to try out parts of the library.
	      It is not meant to be part of the library and serves as development 
          aid only. Hopefully it will be replaced by a test suite some day.


Documentation
-------------

There are two types of HTML documentation. The API documentation describes the 
AgentXcpp API and is intended for the user of the library. The internals 
documentation is the complete reference of the library, describing all 
internals, including things such as the build system.

To build the documentation, cd to the top level directory (the one containing 
this README) and type
    
    scons

This builds the library as well as both documentations. You need Scons to be 
installed, though. To build the documentation without using scons, cd into the
doc/ direcory and type

    doxygen api.doxyfile

respectively
    
    doxygen internals.doxyfile

After buidling, the documentation can be displayed by pointing a web browser to 
doc/api/html/index.html respectively doc/internals/html/index.html.



Happy hacking :-)

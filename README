About
-----

AgentXcpp is a C++ implementation of the AgentX protocol (RFC 2741).

The AgentX protocol is used to implement SNMP MIBs as subagents, which are 
separate processes connecting to a master agent, which in turn provides a SNMP 
interface to the outside world. Thus, agentXcpp is used to implement a SNMP 
MIB.

This README introduces the directory structure and describes how to build the 
documentation. Further information can be found in the documentation.


Status
------

THIS SOFTWARE IS CURRENTLY NOT USABLE.

It is work in progress.  Unfortunately, the author has little time to work on 
the software. It is expected that basic functionality is available by end of 
2011.


Directory Structure
-------------------

The top level directory contains the following elements:

doc/ This directory contains the documentation. Note that the documentation is 
     created using Doxygen and most of it is contained in the source code.  The 
     doc/ directory contains the doxygen configs, some additional documentation 
     files (*.dox) and a SConscript to build the documentation.

src/ This directory contains the source code of the library.

main.cpp This is very hackish test code, just to try out parts of the library.  
	 It is not meant to be part of the library and serves as development 
	 aid only. Hopefully it will be replaced by a test suite.

SConstruct This file provides the possibility to build the library and the
	   documentation.

rfc2741_AgentX.txt The RFC describing the AgentX protocol. This is the 
		   reference for the AgentXcpp implementation.


Documentation
-------------

There are two types of HTML documentation. The API documentation describes the 
AgentXcpp API and is intended for the user of the library. The internals 
documentation is the complete reference of the library, describing all 
internals, including other things such as the build system.

To build the documentation, cd to the top level directory (the one containing 
this README) and type
    
    scons

This builds the library as well as both documentations. You need Scons to be 
installed, though. To build the documentation without using scons, cd into den 
doc/ direcory and type either

    doxygen api.doxyfile

or
    
    doxygen internals.doxyfile

After buidling, the documentation can be displayed by pointing a web browser to 
doc/api/html/index.html respectively doc/internals/html/index.html.

Happy hacking :-)

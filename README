About this README
-----------------

This README gives a short overview of the agentXcpp project, introduces the 
repository's directory structure and describes how to build the documentation.  
Further information can then be found in the documentation.


About agentXcpp
---------------

AgentXcpp is a C++ implementation of the AgentX protocol (RFC 2741).

The AgentX protocol is used to implement SNMP MIBs as subagents, which are 
separate processes connecting to a master agent, which in turn provides a SNMP 
interface to the outside world.


Status of the project
---------------------

This version is NOT USABLE.

This version supports writing subagents. Only Get requests are currently 
implemented.  Set requests and notifications are not supported, and there is 
also no aid to implement tables.

Read the ChangeLog file to learn more.


Roadmap
-------

This is the roadmap for the next versions:

  Version 0.2
    SET functionality and Notifications/Traps working.
 
  Version 0.3
    Tables are working. This will be the first version which can be used in 
    real projects.

  Version 0.3.x
    I plan to provide multiple 0.3.x versions which don't add many new features 
    regarding the AgentX protocol. These updates are mainly intended to improve 
    the API, based on the experiences in real projects, and to clean up and 
    possibly redesign the internal structure of agentXcpp. I plan to release 
    new versions quite often, so that even small changes get published 
    quickly.

Directory Structure
-------------------

The top level directory contains the following elements:

AUTHORS
	Contains the author(s) of the agentXcpp library.

LICENSE
        Contains the AgentXcpp library LICENSE, which basically consists of the 
        GPL and an additional linking exception.

GPLv3
	Contains the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, Version 3.

README
	This file.

SConstruct
	AgentXcpp is built using SCons. This file provides the possibility to 
	build the library and the documentation.

doc/
        This directory contains the documentation. The documentation is created 
        using Doxygen and most of the content is contained in the source code. 
        The doc/ directory contains the doxygen configs, some additional 
        documentation files (*.dox) and the RFC 2741.

src/
	This directory contains the source code of the library.


unit_tests/
        This directory contains the unit tests for the agentXcpp components. 
        Note that this is currently rather a skeleton, and no tests are 
        available yet.


Documentation
-------------

There are two types of HTML documentation, the API documentation and the 
'internals' documentation.  The API documentation describes the AgentXcpp API 
and is intended for the user of the library. The internals documentation is the 
complete reference of the library, describing all internals, including things 
such as the build system.

You can build the documentation using SCons or without SCons.

1a) With SCons:
    cd to the top level directory (the one containing this README) and type

      scons

    This builds the library as well as both documentations.

1b) Without SCons:
    cd into the doc/ directory and type

      doxygen api.doxyfile

    respectively

      doxygen internals.doxyfile

2)  After building, the documentation can be displayed by pointing a web 
    browser to

      doc/api/html/index.html

    respectively

      doc/internals/html/index.html.



Happy hacking :-)

- Clean up serializing/deserializing:
  Implementation works, but is somewhat ugly.
- Introduce naming scheme for (private) member variables of classes,
  e.g. with leading underscore. Apply it consistently.
- Check for each (!) function whether all exceptions are catched or documented
  (e.g. exceptions coming from STL, even if they are unlikely)

\page buildsystem The Build System

Currently, no advanced build system is used for AgentXcpp. Instead, simple 
Makefiles are used.

The <tt>src/</tt> directory contains a Makefile which compiles each 
<tt>*.cpp</tt> file into a <tt>*.o</tt> object and finally links all objects 
into an archive.

The doc/ directory contains a Makefile to build the documentations.

The top level directory contains a Makefile providing the targets 
<tt>documentation</tt> (build the documentations), <tt>library</tt> (build the 
library) and <tt>main</tt> (build the hakish test program <tt>main.cpp</tt>).  
The default target builds the library and the main program.

All Makefiles also support the <tt>clean</tt> target.

\page documentation About the Documentation

The AgentXcpp documentation is created using Doxygen. The <tt>doc/</tt> 
directory contains two doxygen configuration files, <tt>api.doxyfile</tt> and 
<tt>internals.doxyfile</tt>. The first one is used to build the API 
documentation while the latter is used for the internals documentation.

The source of documentation is (nearly) identical for both documentations.  
Classes, members, functions, etc. are documented directly in the C++ source 
files, using the <tt>\\internal</tt> keyword or a pair of <tt>\\cond 
INTERNAL</tt> and <tt>\\endcond</tt> to mark internal-only content.  
Documentation blocks marked in this way are included only in the internals 
documentation, because the <tt>INTERNAL_DOCS</tt> configuration item is set to 
<tt>YES</tt> for the internals documentation, but to <tt>NO</tt> for the API 
documentation, and the <tt>ENABLED_SECTIONS</tt> configuration item includes 
the section name "INTERNAL" for the internals documentation (hence 
<tt>\\cond</tt> can test for "INTERNAL").

The <tt>doc/</tt> directory also contains the mainpages (<tt>api.mainpage</tt> 
and <tt>%internals.mainpage</tt>), which are different for the API and the 
internals documentation. The <tt>*.dox</tt> files provide subpages explaining 
the concepts used in the library (e.g. the source of this page is 
<tt>%doc/documentation.dox</tt>).

If you are developing for AgentXcpp, consider the following conventions:
- Use <tt>\\internal</tt> to mark documentation blocks which should 
  <em>not</em> appear in the API documentation. If only a part of the 
  documentation block should be excluded, surround the part to be excluded with 
  <tt>\\internal</tt> and <tt>\\endinternal</tt>. You may also use <tt>\\cond 
  INTERNAL</tt> and <tt>\\endcond</tt>.
- Document each and every item, such as classes, class members, functions, 
  global variables, etc.
- Include a <tt>\\brief</tt> command for every documented item.
- Include a subpage (i.e. a <tt>*.dox</tt> file) for each abstract concept.  
  Add links to that pages to the appropriate mainpage(s).

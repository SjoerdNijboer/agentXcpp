\page documentation About the Documentation

The AgentXcpp documentation is created using Doxygen. The <tt>doc/</tt> 
directory contains two doxygen configuration files, <tt>api.doxyfile</tt> and 
<tt>internals.doxyfile</tt>. The first one is used to build the API 
documentation while the latter is used for the internals documentation.

The source of documentation is (nearly) identical for both documentations.  
Classes, members, functions, etc. are documented directly in the C++ source 
files, using the <tt>\\internal</tt> keyword mark internal-only content. The 
<tt>doc/</tt> directory contains the mainpages (<tt>api.mainpage</tt> and 
<tt>%internals.mainpage</tt>), which are different for the API and the 
internals documentation. The <tt>*.dox</tt> files provide subpages explaining 
the concepts used in the library (e.g. the source of this page is 
<tt>doc/documentation.dox</tt>).

Documentation blocks marked with the <tt>\\internal</tt> keyword are included 
only in the internals documentation (the <tt>INTERNAL_DOCS</tt> configuration 
item is set to <tt>YES</tt> for the internals documentation, but to <tt>NO</tt> 
for the API documentation).  The API documentation contains only documentation 
blocks which are not marked with <tt>\\internal</tt>. This is also true for the 
codeblocks in <tt>*.dox</tt> files (e.g. this page is not included in the API 
documentation).

If you are developing for AgentXcpp, consider the following conventions:
- Use <tt>\\internal</tt> to mark documentation blocks which should 
  <em>not</em> appear in the API documentation. If only a part of the 
  documentation block should be excluded, surround the part to be excluded with 
  <tt>\\internal</tt> and <tt>\\endinternal</tt>.
- Document each and every item, such as classes, class members, functions, 
  global variables, etc.
- Include a <tt>\\brief</tt> command for every documented item.
- Include a subpage (i.e. a <tt>*.dox</tt> file) for each abstract concept.  
  Add links to that pages to the appropriate mainpage(s).

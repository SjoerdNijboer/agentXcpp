\page installation Building and Installing AgentXcpp

If you are lucky, there is a package for your system which can be easily 
installed. If you are not so lucky, or if you are a package maintainer, you 
have to compile agentXcpp yourself. Here is how to do this.

\note The build process can be accelerated with the <tt>-j i</tt> parameter, 
      where i is the maximum number of threads used. As a rule of thumb, use i 
      = (number_of_cpus + 1).



\section installation_prerequisites Prerequisites

The following software is needed to build agentXcpp, simply use the versions 
which are easily available for your system:
- Standard build environment (compiler, linker, etc.)
- Doxygen, to build the documentation
- SCons, to control the build process
- The following boost libraries:
  - Asio
  - Bind
  - Smart Ptr
  - Test



\section installation_installingSystem Building and installing agentXcpp

Building and installing agentXcpp is a one-step operation: one command builds 
the library and installs all files.  The place where they are is installed can 
freely be chosen.  If you want to make an agentXcpp package, you probably need 
to install into a local directory.  If you are an end user you certainly want 
to install into the system such that you can use the library.

To install it into a linux system, the following command should work:

\verbatim
# To install into a linux system, do as root:
scons install --prefix /usr
\endverbatim

This will install the headers into <tt>/usr/include/agentxcpp/</tt>, the shared 
library to <tt>/usr/lib/</tt> and the API documentation to 
<tt>/usr/share/doc/agentxcpp/</tt>. If want to install into a local directory, 
use:

\verbatim
# To install locally, do:
scons install --prefix ./usr
\endverbatim

This will install the headers, shared library, and the API documentation to 
<tt>./usr/include/agentxcpp/</tt>, <tt>./usr/lib/</tt> and 
<tt>./usr/share/doc/agentxcpp/</tt>, respectively. You can pick them up there 
for your package.

In any case, you can control the individual installation directories like so:

\verbatim
# To choose each directory separately:
scons install --libdir /usr/lib \
              --docdir /opt/agentxcpp/doc \
              --includedir /usr/include/agentxcpp \

# This will do the same:
scons install --prefix=/usr/lib \
              --docdir=/opt/agentxcpp/doc
\endverbatim

\page installation Building and Installing AgentXcpp

If you are lucky, there is a package for your system which can be easily 
installed. If you are not so lucky, or if you are a package maintainer, you 
have to compile agentXcpp yourself. Here is how to do this.



\section installation_prerequisites Prerequisites

The following software is needed to build agentXcpp, simply use the versions 
which are easily available for your system:
- Standard build environment (compiler, linker, etc.)
- Doxygen, to build the documentation (version 1.8.1.2 is recommended)
- The dot tool from the graphviz package, which is used by doxygen to generate 
  diagrams
- SCons, to control the build process
- The following QT4 libraries:
  - QtCore
  - QNetwork



\section installation_installingSystem Building and installing agentXcpp

Building and installing agentXcpp is a one-step operation: one command builds 
the library and installs all files.  The place where they are is installed can 
freely be chosen.  If you want to make an agentXcpp package, you probably need 
to install into a local directory.  If you are an end user you certainly want 
to install into the system such that you can use the library.

To install it into a linux system, the following command should work:

\verbatim
# To install into a linux system, do as root:
scons install --prefix /usr
\endverbatim

\note The build process can be accelerated by givin the <tt>-j i</tt> parameter 
      to SCons, where i is the maximum number of threads used. As a rule of 
      thumb, use i = (number_of_cpus + 1).

Instead of becoming root, you can also use the \c sudo command.

\note Using the <tt>sudo</tt> command may fail on some systems, because the 
      environment provided by <tt>sudo</tt> may be insufficient for scons.

The shown command will install the headers into 
<tt>/usr/include/agentxcpp/</tt>, the shared library to <tt>/usr/lib/</tt> and 
the API documentation to <tt>/usr/share/doc/agentxcpp/</tt>. If want to install 
into a local directory, use:

\verbatim
# To install locally, do:
scons install --prefix ./usr
\endverbatim

This will install the headers, shared library, and the API documentation to 
<tt>./usr/include/agentxcpp/</tt>, <tt>./usr/lib/</tt> and 
<tt>./usr/share/doc/agentxcpp/</tt>, respectively. You can pick them up there 
for your package.

In addition, you can control the individual installation directories like so:

\verbatim
# To choose each directory separately:
scons install --libdir /usr/lib \
              --docdir /opt/agentxcpp/doc \
              --includedir /usr/include/agentxcpp \

# This will do the same:
scons install --prefix=/usr \
              --docdir=/opt/agentxcpp/doc
\endverbatim

If completely omit the <tt>--prefix</tt>, <tt>--libdir</tt>, <tt>--docdir</tt> 
and <tt>--includedir</tt> parameters, the default prefix will be used (the 
default prefix can be obtained with <tt>scons --help</tt>).

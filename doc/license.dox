\section license_foreword Foreword

The agentXcpp software is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), 
plus a linking exception.  The GPL was designed to give the program's users the 
four essential freedoms:
- The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).
- The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what 
  she wishes (freedom 1).
- The freedom to redistribute copies (freedom 2).
- The freedom to distribute copies of modified versions to others (freedom 3).

In addition, the GPL guarantees that these freedoms remain intact when the 
software is distributed, be it unmodified or modified.

However, there is one freedom that the GPL denies to the user of a GPL'ed \em 
library: the freedom to license her own code however she wishes. Each program 
that uses a GPL'ed library becomes "infected" and must be released under the 
terms of the GPL.  In particular, there is no way to use such a library in a 
proprietary software, even if the library itself is kept intact and distributed 
under the terms of the GPL.

The only way to use a C++ library (or to "run" it, as termed in freedom 0) is 
by using its interfaces in another program and linking the library to that 
other program.  Therefore, the GPL provides freedom 0 to the user only as long 
as she either don't give her code away or she licenses her code under the terms 
of the GPL.  The author of agentXcpp considers "using a library" to not create 
a derivative or combined work. Using the library should not restrict the user's 
choice of how to license her own work - its up to the creator of \em that 
program to choose a license.

The Lesser General Public License (LGPL) would have been an alternative to the 
GPL, but it imposes some requirements to the user to be compliant to the 
license.  Although these requirements are in principal acceptable, it is hard 
to understand what is exactly required. In practice the library will be used by 
developers, not lawyers, which makes ensuring compliance with the LGPL even 
harder.

Therefore, the agentXcpp library is licensed under the GPL, with a linking 
exception, to ensure ease of use even in non-free software. Note that the 
library may be \em used without any further restrictions, but changing it and
copying its code is still covered by the GPL. In particular, the agentXcpp 
source code must be made available whenever an agentXcpp-based program is 
distributed.


\section license_agentxcppLicense The agentXcpp License

The agentXcpp library is licenced under the GPL plus a linking exception.  
However, the files located in the <tt>site_scons</tt> subdirectory belong to 
the SCons project and are licensed differently. The applicable license is 
stated within each of these files.

Here is the license of the AgentXcpp project (\e excluding the files in 
<tt>site_scons</tt>):

\verbinclude LICENSE



\section license_gpl The GPL

The agentXcpp license is the GNU General Public License (GPL), plus a linking 
exception. Here is a verbatim copy of the GPL:


\verbinclude GPLv3

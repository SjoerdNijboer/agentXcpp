\section foreword Foreword

The agentXcpp software is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), 
plus a linking exception.  The GPL was designed to give the program's users the 
four essential freedoms:
- The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).
- The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what 
  she wishes (freedom 1).
- The freedom to redistribute copies (freedom 2).
- The freedom to distribute copies of modified versions to others (freedom 3).

In addition, the GPL garantuees that these freedoms remain intact when the 
software is distributed, be it unmodified or modified.

However, there is one freedom that the GPL denies to the user of a GPL'ed \em 
library: the freedom to license her own code however she wishes. Each program 
that uses a GPL'ed library becomes "infected" and must be released under the 
terms of the GPL.  In particular, there is no way to use such a library in a 
proprietary software, even if the library itself is kept intact and distributed 
under the terms of the GPL.

The only way to use a C++ library (or to "run" it, as termed in freedom 0) is 
by using its interfaces in another program and linking the library to that 
other program.  Therefore, the GPL provides freedom 0 to the user only as long 
as she either don't give her code away or she licenses her code under the terms 
of the GPL.  The author of agentXcpp considers "using a library" to not create 
a derivative or combined work. Using the library should not restrict the user's 
choice of how to license her own work - its up to the creator of \em that 
program to choose a license..

The Lesser General Public License (LGPL) would have been an alternative to the 
GPL, but it imposes some requirements to the user to be compliant to the 
license.  Although these requirements are in principal acceptable, it is hard 
to understand what is exactly required. In practice the library will be used by 
developers, not lawyers, which makes ensuring compliance with the LGPL even 
harder.

Therefore, the agentXcpp library is licensed under the GPL, with a linking 
exception, to ensure ease of use even in non-free software. Note that the 
library may be \em used without any further restrictions, but changing it and
copying its code is still covered by the GPL.

Finally, a word on non-copyleft licenses (e.g. the well-known BSD-licenses).  
The authour could have choosen one of them. This would have made agentXcpp a 
free software, but these licenses do not ensure that the software remains free.  
For the author, it was not an option that users (especially companies) could 
benefit from their improvements to free software while not giving them back to 
the community.  In the authors opinion it is acceptable that changes to a 
freesoftware are made available to other users, even for companies.

version.

AgentXcpp is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY

You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along 
with AgentXcpp.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a 
combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU 
General Public License cover the whole combination.

As a special exception, the copyright holder of this library gives you the 
following permissions:

1) The permission to link this library with independent modules to produce
   an executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent 
   modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of 
   your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent 
   module, the terms and conditions of the license of that module. An 
   independent module is a module which is not derived from or based on this 
   library.

2) The permission to instantiate templates, use macros and/or use inline
   functions provided by the library without causing the resulting work to be 
   covered by the GNU General Public License, provided you don't copy code 
   from the library to your program.

If you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of 
the library, but you are not obliged to do so. If you do not wish to do so, 
delete this exception statement from your version.

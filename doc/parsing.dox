\page parsing Parsing

This section explains how parsing is done in agentxcpp.

AgentX PDUs are read from a stream, while constructing C++ objects which 
represents the PDUs and all its parts in memory. To read an entity from the 
stream, the stream object is provided to the constructor of that entity. The 
constructor then reads the serialized form of the object from the stream, 
constructing that object.

For example, to read an AgentX PDU (Processing Data Unit) from the stream, the 
stream object (e.g. an ifstream object or even the cin object) is given to the 
constructor of the pdu class. This constructor will read the PDU header from 
the stream, then detect which type of PDU is being read and create such an 
object (e.g. a getpdu), giving the stream to the constructor of it. This is 
repeated to read the OID and the varbind objects, this creating several objects 
in memory which initializes themselves from the input stream. Finally, the 
complete PDU is constructed and the next PDU can be read by creating a new pdu 
object, giving the stream to its constructor.

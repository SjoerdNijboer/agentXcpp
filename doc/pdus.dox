\page pdus The PDU Objects

The %PDU objects, such as OpenPDU, RegisterPDU and so on represent the AgentX 
Protocol Data Units. Each of these classes inherits from the abstract PDU class 
which can be said to represent the header of a %PDU (although it also manages 
the 'context', which is not strictly part of the PDU header).  The header is 
identical for each %PDU.

The concrete %PDU classes mainly serve as data containers, holding the 
information which is required by RFC 2741 and providing functionality to 
serialize and deserialize the %PDU. Each field of the class can be manipulated 
using setters and getters. For example, the OpenPDU class has the set_descr() 
and get_descr() methods to manipulate the 'descr' field (see RFC 2741, '6.2.1.  
The agentx-Open-PDU' for an explanation of the field). The PDU class also 
provides such setters and getters to manipulate the header fields.

Each concrete %PDU class also has a default constructor which initializes the 
object to its default values. These default constructors also invoke the 
constructor of the base class, PDU, which initializes the header fields to 
their default values.

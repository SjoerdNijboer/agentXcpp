\page release_howto How to create an agentXcpp release

Creating releases should be a process which creates packages reproducible, 
consistent packages of the software.

-# Update the ChangeLog. Check it in.
-# Choose a git commit which shall be released.
-# Test the chosen commit:<br/>
   -# Clone the repo to a fresh directory, avoid having untracked files.  
   Alternatively, remove ALL untracked files from your working copy.
   -# Checkout the chosen commit
   -# Build the software
   -# Perform the howto (\ref subagent_howto).
   -# If the test fails: no release possible; fix it and re-start from the 
      beginning. If the test succeeds: continue.
-# Create a git tag for the release.<br/>
   Each release shall have a tag to uniqely identify it.
-# Create the packages, preferably using the create-release.sh script.<br/>
   The packages shall have the names agentXcpp-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz and 
   agentXcpp-&lt;version&gt;.zip respectively, where &lt;version&gt; is the 
   tag name.  The contents shall be a single directory named 
   agentXcpp-&lt;version&gt;.  This directory shall contain the source code.  
   This is all ensured by the create_release.sh script.
-# Test one of the packages.<br/>
   -# Unpack it
   -# Build the contained software
   -# Perform the howto (\ref subagent_howto).
   -# If the test fails: no release possible; fix it and re-start from the 
      beginning.
-# If the test succeeds, the release can be published.

\page release_howto How to create an agentXcpp release

AgentXcpp releases are provided as tarball as well as as zip file. Both 
packages contain exactly the same data.

Releases are published once and cannot be revoked thereafter. Therefore, the 
process by which a release is created must ensure that the package maintains 
high quality. Each release shall be reproducible and allocatable to a commit in 
the source code repository. Further, an up-to-date ChangeLog shall be provided, 
and the released packages shall follow consistent naming conventions.  To 
comply with these requirements, the following procedure shall be applied 
whenever an official release is created:

-# Update the ChangeLog. Check it in.
-# Create an annotated git tag for the release.<br/>
   Each release shall have a tag to uniqely identify it. <b>Do not push</b> the 
   tag yet.
-# Create the packages using the create-release.sh script.<br/>
   The packages shall have the names agentXcpp-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz and 
   agentXcpp-&lt;version&gt;.zip respectively, where &lt;version&gt; is the 
   tag name.  The contents shall be a single directory named 
   agentXcpp-&lt;version&gt;.  This directory shall contain the source code.  
   This is all ensured by the create_release.sh script.
-# Test one of the packages:<br/>
   -# Unpack it.
   -# Build and install the contained software.
   -# If the test fails: no release possible; remove the tag, fix the problem
   and re-start from step 1.
-# If the test succeeds, the packages and the tag can be published.

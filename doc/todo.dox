\page todo TODO

- Add unit tests
- Clean up serializing/deserializing: Implementation works, but is somewhat  
  ugly.
- Introduce naming scheme for (private) member variables of classes, e.g. with 
  leading underscore. Apply it consistently.
- Check for each (!) function whether all exceptions are catched or documented   
  (e.g. exceptions coming from STL, even if they are unlikely)
- Better handling of documentation building (use scons Doxygen builder)
- Check code for memory leaks
- Consider providing the endianess choice for serializing (currently always big 
  endian is used for serializing)
- Cleanup helper.hpp and types.hpp

\page todo TODO

Essential TODOs:
-# Add a build system
-# Provide session management (i.e. a Session class)
-# Provide possibility to register SNMP variables
-# Provide GET functionality
-# Provide SET functionality
-# Provide NOTIFY (a.k.a. Trap) functionality
-# Provide support for tables

Further TODOs:
- Add unit tests
- Clean up serializing/deserializing: Implementation works, but is somewhat  
  ugly.
- Introduce naming scheme for (private) member variables of classes, e.g. with 
  leading underscore. Apply it consistently.
- Check for each (!) function whether all exceptions are catched or documented   
  (e.g. exceptions coming from STL, even if they are unlikely)
